## 📖 Detailed Description  
Onboarding new clients often requires creating Google Drive folders, sending emails, and updating logs—tasks that take **1–2 hours per client** and risk human error.  

This workflow automates the process by:  
- Triggering on new **Google Form submissions**  
- Creating structured **Google Drive folders**  
- Routing project requests into **Asana**  
- Sending a **welcome email**  
- Logging activity in **Google Sheets**  

✨ **Target Users**: Consultancy businesses & freelancers handling projects in Automation, Data Analysis, or Cloud Migration.  
✨ **Integrations**: Google Workspace (storage & email), Asana (project management), Airtable (CRM staging).  
✨ **Impact**:  
- ⏳ 70% time reduction (from 120 mins → 30–40 mins)  
- 📂 Consistent folder structures  
- 📧 Automated, personalized communication

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Trigger** → Google Sheets Trigger detects a new onboarding record.  
2. **Data Staging** → Airtable Search node checks for duplicates.  
3. **Project Creation** → Switch node directs to the correct Asana project (Automation, Data Analysis, or Cloud Migration).  
4. **Folder Creation** → Google Drive node builds a client folder + subfolders (Contracts, Assets, Reports).  
5. **Email Notification** → Gmail node sends a welcome email with links.  
6. **Logging** → Google Sheets logs key details (Timestamp, Email, Project).  

🔗 **Logic/Dependencies**: Switch node ensures only the relevant Asana node executes.
